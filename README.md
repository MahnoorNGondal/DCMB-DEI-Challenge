# DCMB-DEI-Challenge

# Overview

The objective of this work was to investigate if gene expression omnibus (GEO) datasets are biased related to the US population using DEI criteria (sex, ethnicity, ancestry). Towards this aim, the following salients stages were undertaken. In stage one, we collected and filtered datasets from GEO relevant to our objective, and in stage two, we analyzed and computed a rank for each dataset towards identifying and scoring the highest to the lowest of GEO datasets biased for DEI criteria. The following sections will discuss these stages in detail.
